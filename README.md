Some improvements for the [Onboard](https://launchpad.net/onboard) on-screen keyboard full keyboard layout.

- Removed some unneeded keys: close buttons, "abc" layer ("123" already toggles it), mouse drag/hover, mouse actions toggle.
- Removed Ins/Scrl/Pause and moved right/middle click to keep the spacing between F-key groups.

## Installation

Copy the files to the layouts dir (`~/.local/share/onboard/layouts/` or "Open layout folder" in settings) and choose this layout in settings.
